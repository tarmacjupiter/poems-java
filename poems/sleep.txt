POEM ABOUT GOING TO SLEEP (IGNORE THIS LINE)
Slugglishy moving up the steps
Struggling to keep my eyes open
Peeling the glasses off my face
Pulling the light switch down
The moon limps its way into the window
Swallowed by the bed
I ponder about my life
What will I do with my chaotic, and beautiful life?
